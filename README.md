# Safety-Lock
This repository contains a password-proteected lock based on AVR ATmega32 microcontroller.

>**Used drivers:**
>1. DIO (for port names macros).
>2. EEPROM (a non-volatile memory for password storage).
>3. LCD (for user inputs).
>4. Keypad (for accepting user inputs).

#### Note:
A demo video is added to test the code against different test cases.
